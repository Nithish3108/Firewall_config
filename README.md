# Firewall Task - Linux

## Objective
Configure and test basic firewall rules using UFW on Kali Linux.

## What I Did
- Enabled UFW firewall
- Added a rule to block inbound traffic on port 23 (Telnet)
- Tested blocking by attempting a Telnet connection (which failed)
- Allowed SSH (port 22) for remote access
- Removed the test block rule to restore original state
